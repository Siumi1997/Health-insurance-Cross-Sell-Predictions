# Health-insurance-Cross-Sell-Predictions


Most of the companies in the world cross-sell their new products to their existing customers before launching them to the open market. Cross-sell helps the company to reduce time and cost by finding the right type of customers to sell the product and by optimizing their communication plan. The main objective is to find the best accurate model to predict whether the policyholders are interested in the new vehicle insurance offered or not.
